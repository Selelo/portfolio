# Portfolio

NB: This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.1.

# How I did it...

This project showcases my portfolio and previous works using Angular. The purpose of this web app is to present my skills and projects in a structured and visually appealing manner. Below are videos demonstrating the progress of the app development:

## Purpose of the App

The main goal of this web app is to serve as a portfolio to display my previous works, skills, and accomplishments in the field of web development and UI design. It includes sections for my projects, an about me section, and a way for potential clients or employers to view my work.
